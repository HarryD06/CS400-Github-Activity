A Long time ago in a galaxy far far away....

There was a dog named Kevin. Kevin was a young golden retriever with a lot of energy and smiles. He was
playing fetch with his owner one day, this was his favorite activity. His owner threw the stick into the sky
and Kevin began sprinting to where he thought it would land. But once he got there, there was no stick! Where
did it go?
